Unforgotchi - Android Reminder Application

Who doesn't know the feeling of standing right in front of the subway, just to realize that one forgot to bring a mask? With Unforgotchi, this problem is forever solved!

In this useful application, users can create multiple lists of commonly forgotten items in certain circumstances. They can create locations based on WiFi IDs. When creating or editing a location, a list is chosen. As soon as the WiFi connections is interrupted, the user receives a push notification containing all the items of the specified list - unless the subway is right next to the door, Unforgotchi will save the user from loosing much valuable time!

Unforgotchi was a group assignment at our university. The collaborators are Paul Felknerl, LaurinBGerhardt and Janka Deldok.
